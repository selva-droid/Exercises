# Week 02 Assignment - Python Exercises

### Author: Perumal Selvarajah  
#### Date: 2024-09-08  

## Project Overview:
This project contains five Python exercises, which are aimed at developing basic Python programming skills such as variable manipulation, control flow, and user interaction. Below is a summary of each task in the project.

---

### Q1: Mathematical Calculation
**Objective**:  
- Define two variables with values of `100` and `29`.
- Sum these two values and multiply the result by `3`.
- Square the final result and display it in the specified format:
  
  Output:
  ```
  The result of the calculation was:
      149769
  ```

**Key Concepts**: Variables, Arithmetic operations, and Formatted output.

### Q2: Password Generator
**Objective**:  
- The program prompts the user to input their name, age, and year of birth.
- It then generates a password using the following logic:
  - Last two digits of the year of birth.
  - First three letters of the user's name.
  - The square of the user's age.
  
  Output example for user input `Selva, 29, 1989`:
  ```
  Your password is: 89sel841
  ```

**Key Concepts**: String slicing, User input, Data types, and Arithmetic operations.

### Q3: Number Even/Odd Check
**Objective**:  
- The program asks the user to input two numbers.
- It checks whether both, one, or neither of the numbers are even and prints the result accordingly:
  - If both numbers are even: `"Both numbers are even."`
  - If one of the numbers is even: `"One of the numbers is even."`
  - If neither of the numbers is even: `"Both numbers are odd."`

**Key Concepts**: Conditionals (if/else), Modulus operator (`%`), User input.

---

### Q4: Sum of Numbers
**Objective**:  
- The program prompts the user for an integer input and calculates the sum of all positive numbers from `0` to the user’s input.
  
  Output example for input `12`:
  ```
  The sum was: 66
  ```

**Key Concepts**: Loops (while), User input, Arithmetic operations.

### Q5: Number Guessing Game
**Objective**:  
- A guessing game between the Dealer and the Player.
- The Dealer generates a random number between 0 and 10, and the Player attempts to guess the number.
- The program gives hints (higher/lower) based on the Player's guess and displays the total number of tries once the correct number is guessed.

  Example interaction:
  ```
  Welcome to the guessing game!
  Guess the number (between 0 and 10): 5
  Try a smaller number.
  Guess the number (between 0 and 10): 3
  That's right! Number of tries: 2
  ```

**Key Concepts**: Random number generation, Loops, Conditionals, User input.
